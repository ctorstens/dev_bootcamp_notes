# Mixins
---

> A mixin is a class that is mixed with a module. In other words the implementation of the class and module are joined, intertwined, combined, etc. A mixin is a different mechanism to the extend construct used to add concrete implementation to a class. With a mixin you can extend from a module instead of a class.
