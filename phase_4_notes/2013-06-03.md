### GIT

JTBD
- job to be done
- clayton christiensen
    - Innovator's Dilemma

- tell a story about how the project got to where it's at
- communicate intention of changes to other team members

- git aliases

#### [git-sh]((https://github.com/rtomayko/git-sh))

```
$ git-sh
$ command rm example.txt
$ git ll
$ git show
$ git checkout --orphan my-new-branch
$ c 098asdf
$ set
$ env

```

What every unix program gets: env, args, stdin

What every unix program outputs: stdout, stderror (should be called: stmessage)


Add these lines to your ```~/.bash_profile```

```
subl='/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl'
test -x "$subl" && export EDITOR="'$subl' --wait"
```

> If you're curious, this is shell code. The first line is assigning a string to a variable (looks pretty normal). The second line checks if the file name pointed to by that variable exists and is executable, if so it sets the environment variable EDITOR to that file with the ```--wait``` argument appended to it. Most shell programs like git will respect the value EDITOR and try that before falling back onto some like vim.

create orphan branch AND delete index to start from scratch

rvm bad (over engineered), rbenv good

[github - git-sh](https://github.com/rtomayko/git-sh)


lockdown ruby version

```cat .gitignore```

diff

show me the differences between stages and what's in index

```diff --cached```



#### show

show HEAD

show master

show master:README.md

show master:README.md > README.md

cat server.sh
a Gemfile.lock
unstage .gitignore

if you want to change the most recent commit

```commit --amend```

git-sh shortcut: ```n```


Quotes: Alan Perlis

compare current branch on top of master
diff master
diff HEAD..master
    - master on top of current branch

show master:server.rb > server.rb
d server.rb
    - same as diff server.rb

add --patch server.rb

    - s for split in options

    - then say y or n for each chunch on whether to stage it

d server.rb

p server.rb

take arguments and push onto stdout

```echo```


```push origin -u```

  -u stands for 'track this branch' so you don't have to say origin... again

If you want to switch the
b -d master
c -b master

rbenv - INSTALL IT



[Removing untracked files from your git working copy](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/61212/removing-untracked-files-from-your-git-working-copy)

```git clean -f```



bring all the code from master into the staging area of HEAD

```
git co master -- .
```

unstage all of it

```
git reset --soft
# or
unstage *
# or
rm .git/index
# or
git unstage
```

production stable
  origin/head, origin/master always what's production deployed code


throw anything other than what's the index (those that are added) to the stash
git stash --keep-index


```stash list```

try to keep your stash clean
git-sh shows it's not when there is a dollar sign in the command line






## My Notes

### Optimization

[git gc](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-gc.html)

options

```
-- aggressive
```


Remove old branches that have been deleted on origin

```
git remote prune origin
```


## Workflow for remaking a git history

1. ```$ git checkout --orphan my-new-branch```
2. remove ```rm .git/index```
3. remove all files in dir with ```rm *```
4. copy and paste the results of ```$ git checkout --orphan my-new-branch``` into the newly empty dir
5. commit...
6. Pull in files with ```show master:README.md > README.md```, deleting from your new file that which you wish put postpone commiting
7. To move whole directories: ```git checkout master -- db/migrate```


git co master -- db/migrate
HD

undo last commit
```git reset --soft HEAD^ ```

Placing a specific commit somewhere else in the git history
  1. create the commit
  2. ```rebase -i <future_parent_hash>
  3. Copy & paste the order of the commits to match your desired order.
