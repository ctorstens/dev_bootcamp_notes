# Code Review

> removing code is better than adding it, reading code is harder than writing it
- Myles


### Criteria for bringing in dependencies
- Size of source code relative to the problem it's trying to solve


## INBOX

Keynote at Rails conf
  simplicity matters
  simple vs. easy

'acts-as'
  be cautious, you want control of your data model
  affect
  REMOVE

Bug
  delta between development and production
  separate what you can between test and development (Gemfile)

Feature detect, if ENV present
  stagging environment

Avoid polymorphic table

When writing code, ask yourself, "how easy am I making it to delete this code?"

group declarations together based upon end-point functionality, not because they look the same

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base

  attr_accessible :name
  validates :name, :presence => true

  attr_accessible :email
  validates :email, :presence => true

  attr_accessible :password
  validates :password, :presence => true
  bcrypt_stuff

  def full_name
  end

  def email_something
  end

end
```


## "Don't Reinvent the wheel"

- Need to understand the wheel, look through the source code
    - If that's too exhausting, then it's time to reinvent the wheel.
    - writing a webserver or database is useful


Code Smell: literal encodings in source code

Guard clause

```ruby
return XXXX unless YYYYY
```

```ruby
def video_url
  return nil unless video_domain == 'youtube'
  uri = URI.parse("http://www.youtube.com")
  uri.path = File.join('/', embed', video_url_code)
  uri.param = {html5: 1, vq: 'hd720'}.to_param
  uri.to_s
end
```

%r{(embed/|v=|\.be/)(.{11})}

dont' run regex against html or a url, ur URI library
run tests for regex

rbenv local 1.9

Rack::Utils.parse_query(u.query)

def tag_downcase is mutative

[Idempotence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence)
- may take an action the first time, but not ever after


Move def yt_client to helper

> Models don't always have to do SQL

has_and_belongs_to_many
- > Make the join table explicit with has_many through(Myles)

self.create_with_omniauth
- break into two methods, auth info collection, user creation

.inject(:+)

symbol to proc

<=>
spaceship operator
evalutes if something is -1, 0, or 1
comparison, but not an equality. a greater or less than. an order comparison

```ruby
def self. users_by_karma
  self.all.sort_by(&:karma).reverse
end
```

scopes
  become class methods, that return a scope object that wraps around the query
  a macros
  metaprogramming

Seed file
  talk at the level at the
  SQL inserts

@new_post in seeds
pull into a method
why reload?

Tell a story, with just SQL
   this is the data I'm modelling
   allt he code here maniuples


clear out application controller

direct reder for the respond_to do|format... block

xhr request????

flash???

#### [cargo culting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming)
- [nettuts](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/cargo-culting-in-javascript/)
- copying something without understanding it

avoid policy, it turns into bureuacracy

modularization
