## Modularization


#### Simple *vs* Easy
- **simple is objective**
- **easy is subjective**

oppposite of easy is difficult
opposite of simple is complex

complexity
- entanglement
- !cardinality

#### literal syntax

```java
Array array = newArray(10)
array.push("foo")
```

> "Programmers know the benefit of everything and the cost of nothing"
    - > Rich Hickey

When deciding whether to introduce a dependencey, have to consider the COST as well as the benefit.

Simple data structures
  lean on them
    arrays
    maps

procedural vs object oriented vs functional

#### Object Oriented Programming

- enumerate the possible nouns
- then attributes

entanglement: connecting a lot of sh$t together

#### Functional

function + module

input and output is always data

```
getUsers(org) => [users]
showUnreadCommits()
```

Blog: [Jamie Zawinski](http://www.jwz.org/docs/)


if we delete a commit, we want that feature to go go away without breaking anything


git revert <hash>
- make a new commit, which is a revers of that commit
- is itself a new commit


modules map to files

scope across file boundaries

variables assigned to a file do not make it out of a file when it's required elsewhere

when you use the def keyword, and it doesn't belong anywhere, it becomes availaible in every context

a capital letter gets exported into the outside env
  classes
  constants

use ```require './xxxxxxx'```` instead of ```require_relative 'xxxxxxx'```

[#LoadPath]

modules should only export one constant at a time (something with a capital letter)

perlisms.rb

```ruby

module Perlisms
  extend self
  def random_quote
    "test"
  end
end

Perlisms = Object.new

```

```extend self``` extends all local methods and instance methods will get another method/variable defined on self

```
def random_quote
end
```

gets an additional

```
def self.random_quote
end
```

and

```
@the_var
```

gets an additional

```
@@the_var
```
