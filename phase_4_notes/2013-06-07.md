#### ```current_timeslot.rb```

```ruby
require 'time' # provides Time.parse

# First version by github/shivamd

module CurrentTimeslot

  def is_current_timeslot?(timeslot, current_time = Time.now)
    parse_time_boundaries(timeslot).cover?(current_time)
  rescue ArgumentError, TypeError
    false
  end

  def parse_time_boundaries(timeslot)
    begin_time, end_time = Time.parse(timeslot), Time.parse(timeslot[/\-.+/])
    (begin_time..end_time)
  end

end

if $0 == __FILE__

  include CurrentTimeslot

  now = Time.parse "12:25pm"
  tests = [
    is_current_timeslot?("11:30am - 1 pm",          now),
  ! is_current_timeslot?("Lecture: 10am - 11:30am", now),
    is_current_timeslot?("Lecture: 12pm - 1:30pm",  now),
    is_current_timeslot?("Lecture: 12:25pm - 1pm",  now),
  ! is_current_timeslot?("1pm",                     now),
  ! is_current_timeslot?("No time info",            now)
  ]

  if tests.all? then puts ':)' else abort ':(' end

end
```


---


```ruby
if $0 == __FILE__
```

##### $0
- a global variable
- the first element it ARGV
    - an array of "the shit that launched you"
    - first argument is the name of the file

both $0 and __FILE__ are both constants

if the progam that was laungched the current source file, being interpreseted by the current interpreter

it means they are runign this source file

that program will ever run if that file is being manually ran from the command line, another file is not calling it

every unix process has an argv, and therefore $0
the source file being currently run through the interprester is stored as a constant __FILE__


```ruby
if test.all? then puts ':)' else abort ':(' end
```

is_current_timeslot?
  return true or false


the ```requre 'time'``` adds Time.parse to the already available Time class

tests = [...] returns an array of booleans

```
.all?
```

- checks if they're all true

why ```abort``` and not ```puts```

abort is for errors


```
$ true
$ echo $?
0
```

$?

- value of the last status code

a program returns with anything other than zero exited with an error

> Clean Exit

> Error Exiting

you can make your own error codes e.g. define 2 as network error

5 lines of code can be complex; it's about entangelment

size doesn't indicate complexity, it's entanglement.

### Module Structure

  0. What this things does, but not how it does it. The why, the intention, with a bit of the what.
  1. Declare dependencies ( ```require``` )
  2. Implementation (i.e. the code)
  3. Export (should only be one thing; one file name mapps to one module)


###### *15:24:30*

pull out a model as a module

```gem 'hashugar'```

  open struct (a native, but shitty implementation)
  pick the one that you've read the source code for

```# public api```

a contract that you won't change that code.

don't actually use the private keyworkd, just comemnt it in

> I don't want my program to know about the design of a anoter's implementation

I only care about the things I care about

```
.try
```

soaking
soak operator

```source trello-conf.sh```

- where to keep your sensitive information

15:40:54


in most cases it's better to introduecne dupolication than dependency


pp
pretty print

```__END__```

everything after this is ignored byt the interpreter

Becomes a constant ```DATA```

```ruby
- DATA = YAML.load DATA
+ DATA = YAML.load File.read(__FILE__).split(/^__END__/, 2).last
```

a manual implementation of DATA to read what we want it to, see the problem below

```cd /tmp/```


a.rb

```ruby
puts DATA.read

__END__

hello
```

b.rb

```
require './a'
```

ruby b.rb fails


runs the code in one file, looks for the variable in the other.

helper methods or instance variables in templates is a bad idea. You just want calls to object, which should be data structures. The other stuff is for a presenter.


to set an environment variale that goe sint the outsiede ienv use export

```
export
  TRELLO_KEY=...
export
  TRELLO_TOKEN=...
```

```
require 'benchmark'
time = Benchmark.realtime { timeslots = Timeslots.load_data +}
puts "trello api call took: #{time} seconds"
```

exec

some unix process is running

you can start another one
  starting a subshell, a subprocess, considered t be a child. Daisychain
  killing the parent should clean up the relationship

```exec``` says, dont' run a child process, replace the current process with the new one called by exec

bundle exec
  load a subshell with an env specific t this appplciation
    only use the version of saass, rake... in this
    replace that subshell with whatever process which follows

### Models

edit schema directly and load it until you need the actual migration

```
rake db:schema:load
```

ORM's never have worked correctly

learn about the database you are using, and lean it to the specific features (don't "go abstract", like many advise)

dependent delete
  better to do it in the database
  use the database for the features it provides

#### ```t.foreign_key :lists, depedent: :delete```

```ruby
create_table :todos
t.timestamps

t.references :list
t.foreign_key :lists, depedent: :delete
```

#### [refactor_this/app/models/list.rb](https://github.com/freaking-fiery-skippers/refactor_this/blob/cmpth/app/models/list.rb)
```ruby
class List < ActiveRecord::Base

  # Cascading delete is handled at the db level
  has_many :todos

  # ---

  attr_accessible :name
  validates :name,
    :presence => { :message => 'cant_be_blank' }

end
```

why override the error message?
- with snake case
    - it's more like a symbol, or code. you'd never show it to the user
- Why...
    - why the extra energy?
    - It's not the concern of the model layer to know anything about the user interface.

filter user input at controller layer

filter input and secure outputs
    - how you make a secure application


rails moves it to the model layer with attr_accessible


> If your metric is popularity, you'll succeed by the metric

- myles

  - good speech right before this on attr_accessible

constats don't complain if the inner components are changed (e.g. new hash key/values)

List.destroy_all

Rails.logger.debug "-- done destroying"

# Make some sample data

list = List.create! name: "A list"

Rails.logger.debug "-- done making a list"

Todo.create!(
  title: "A todo",
  :status => "incomplete",
  :list_id => list.id
)

Rails.logger.debug "-- done making todo"

# Print all the sample data

for list in List.all
  puts list.inspect
  for todo in list.todos
    puts '  ' + todo.inspect
  end
end
```


use a for loop when imperitve or procedural

your gonna write controllers that talk json for your api, and controllers that talk html for other stuff. Controllers should only speak one language.

All modules are stored in the helpers folder. a place you can put anything you like.


**Today's lectures make me feel much more at home with rails**

user local variables if you're not rendering a template

create is shorthand for doing new and save

```ruby
  def create
    list = List.create filter_params(List, params)
    attribs, errors = ARD.attrs_and_errs list

    return respond 400, errors if errors.any?

    respond :created, attribs
  end
```

```ruby
class UiController < ApplicationController

  def server
    todo_lists = List.all
    ui_html = UIPresenters::ScreenPresenter.new(:lists_data => todo_lists).render
    render :text => ui_html, :layout => 'server'
  end

  def client
    client_program = ClientTemplateCompiler.compile
    render :text => client_program, :layout => 'client'
  end

end
```

```ruby
ui_html = UIPresenters::ScreenPresenter.new(:lists_data => todo_lists).render
```


##### Should look more like this, on second thought
```ruby
def server
  render()
    UIPresenters::ScreenPresenter.new(
      :lists_data +> List.all
    ).render
  )
end
```


render method should have no side effects
it should be a pure function
the same input should always give the same output


17:40:28

why can't you render twice in the controller, unlike the presenter
  - because a controler does IO
    When you call render onto the controller, it writes those on the client. You can't undo output
    it's the equivalent of
    what's the part of the program which launches the rockets, which has irreversible side effects

the parts shouldn't be mixed, those that have and don't have side-effects

render on the controller
render on the ui presenters
  just another method that you can call over and over again
