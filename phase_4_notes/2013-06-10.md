### Book :Understanding Comics
1. Purpose (idea)
2. Form
3. Ideom
4. Structure
5. Craft
6. Surface

### Wolverine: *The actual process of a comic author*
- Comic writers actually get into it via the reverse method (e.g. Surface to craft, to structure...)
- Phase 4 is about helping us to learn the fundamentals first.

### Closure
- The value of a comic isn't in the panels, it lies in what's between them, where your imagination links one state to the next.

## Pipelining

Hooking one process's ```stout``` to another's ```stdin```

Unix Processes
- Inputs
  - what are the inputs you get for every new input process
      - stdin
          - Ruby sucks at this
          - STREAM
      - Environment Variables
      - Command Line Arguments (i.e. Arg V)
- Outputs
    - Status Code or "Exit Code"
        - integer
    - stdout
        - STREAM
    - sterror (badly named, should be called stdmessage)
        - STREAM
- OTHER *(not as important for web developers)*
  - File System
  - Network
  - Graphics System (windowing System)
  - Audio System


you don't hook up ```stderror``` to something else

ping
- sends a packet to a server and sees how long it takes

latency
- how long it takes the server to respond to that ping

```
cat
```

redirect character >
takes the stout and writes it to a file

```
cat test.txt | wc

#  Shell pipelines

echo foo | uppercase > somefile.txt

File.write( 'somefile.txt', uppercase("foo") )

cat /usr/share/dict/words | grep ^A

cat /usr/share/dict/words | grep ^A > words-beginning-with-a.txt

cat ffs-lecture-1-git-and-unix.mp4 | gzip > zipped.zip

```

we wouldn't have anything if we didn't have this context of read a little bit, do a little bit, read a little bit, do a little bit

**THE ABOVE NOTES ARE INCOMPLETE**



## Node.js

- Designed for non-blocking code
    - doesn't stop the program from running?
- Callbacks
- Server-side js
- NPM
- Built off google's V8
- Execellent stdlib (where all IO calls are non-blocking)
- Excellent module system
- Excellent packaging and distrubution system
- Shitty programming language
- Pretty solid culture and community
- Author: Ryan Dahl
    - Ruby programmer
        - wrote 'eb', 'evented' web server

What does blocking code mean?
- It waits until it will get returned, then goes to the code below it.

What kind of code can even be non-blocking
- something that causes you to wait
    - What causes waiting: I/O = Input/Output

### Computer Memory Comparison
- register memory in the CPU
    - fastest memory the computer has access to
    - "the piece of paper in front of the person"
- CPU cache
    - Second fastest
    - "stacks of paper on the desk"
- RAM or memory
    - Third fast
    - "filing cabinets behind you"
- HD
    - Fourth fast
    - "go down to basement, 20 flights, go into massive wearhouse of filing cabinits"
        - difference between accessing memory and accessing HD

### Non-blocking I/O
- It's like asking an assistant to go to the HD while you keep working, then the assistant comes back and tells you when they get back.
- It's harder to program because you're programming the assistant as well.
- Used to optimize

### Network I/O
- Talking over the network is like getting messages via a bike messenger; you don't know when they'll be back or not, unlike HD which is long, but known. You usually have to set some type of timer.

```
# Blocking I/O
Post.all.each do |post|
```

event-loop systems

dtrace

### Example of Node.js

#### ```names.txt```

```
myles
chris
vincent
jared
```

#### ```ruby-version.rb```

```ruby
# read names.txt, return an array of uppercased names

def uppercase_names filename
  # name = File.read(file_name).split.map {|name|| name.upcase}
  File.read(file_name).split.map $:upcase # symbol to proc
end

uppercase_names('names.txt')
```

#### ```node-version.js```

```javascript
function uppercaseNames(filename, myCallback) {
  fs.readFile(filename, 'utf-8', function(err, fileContents) {
    if (err) { myCallback(err); return }
    var contents = fileContents
      .trim()
      .split('\n')
      .map(function(word) {
        return word.toUpperCase()
      })
    myCallback(err, contents)
  })
}

uppercaseNames('names.txt', function(err, names) {
  if (err) console.log(err)
  console.log(names)
})
```

[Node Docs](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_filename_options_callback)

The file system library is called fs

function literal
- it was literally in the source code, that's when it was created

When does a node program exit?

- When there are no more call backs queued on the event loop.

atone for the sins of the father
an array of bytes is not a string

the class for a binary array is called a buffer

16:14:24

if your file clerk isn't leaving his desk the code is very reliable. His assistants are not, that code can fail for a number of reasons.
that's why it's important to have code that deals with errors, any time you're using your 'assistants'


Don't really need semicolons, often anyway.

[ECMA ASI](http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-7.9.1)

```throw``` crashes the program

For the most part you use exception handling in node, you deal with them explicitly

The node equivalent of irb is to type ```node``` into the console
