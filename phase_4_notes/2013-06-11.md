    - Callback Pattern
    - Stream Pattern

Js version is a lot more code

asynchronous IO, it's not jsut that it's in js

#### Without asynchronous IO
```js
var fs = require('fs')

function uppercaseNames(filename) {
  return fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf8')
    .trim()
    .split('\n')
    .map(function(word) {
      return word.toUpperCase()
    })
}
console.log(uppercaseNmaes('names.txt'))
```

#### [Js](https://github.com/torsday/dev_bootcamp_notes/blob/master/phase_4_notes/2013-06-10.md#node-versionjs) vs [Ruby](https://github.com/torsday/dev_bootcamp_notes/blob/master/phase_4_notes/2013-06-10.md#ruby-versionrb) versions
- lot bigger
- lot more nesting (jagged left edge)
- harder logic to wrap your head around

[yesterday's version](https://github.com/torsday/dev_bootcamp_notes/blob/master/phase_4_notes/2013-06-10.md#node-versionjs): the callback pattern

today: the stream pattern


Node is userful when that 'file clerk' is doing 20 jobs for 20 yusers, what a webserer is

the server shoudl be able to do work as soon as it's able to do work

11:46:12

Being clever iwth the architecture is how we optimize without getting to the hardware level

Threaded codes in Ruby

#### ```timers.rb```
```ruby
loop do
  puts "tick"
  sleep 1
end
```

#### ```timers2_broken.rb```
```ruby
loop do
  puts "tick"
  sleep 1
end

# NEVER GETS HERE
loop do
  puts "tock"
  sleep 1
end
```

[Ruby docs: Thread](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Thread.html)

#### ```timers_threaded.rb```
```ruby
t1 = Thread.new do
  loop do
    puts "tick"
    sleep 1
  end
end

t2 = Thread.new do
  loop do
    puts "tock"
    sleep 1
  end
end

[t1,t2].jeach &:join
```

##### Results
```
tick
tock
tock
tick
ticktock

ticktock
```

#### Guess at implementation of "puts"
```ruby
def puts arg
  STDOUT.write arg
  STDOUT.write "\n"
end

# not
def puts arg
  STDOUT.write arg + "\n"
end
```

If one program does a blocking io call, you can give

To share information, you need to use locks;

from inside a thread, you can talk up to the parent schedullers
using the lock call tells the scheluline to under no circumstances be kciked off  of the cpu i ...locks get complex and unweildy.

Threads are a low-level way to get parallelism

Node works with one thread on your side, it uses other threads, but you're not allowed to touch them.

#### Node version ```timers.js```
```js
setInterval(function(){
  console.lg("tick")
}, 1000)

setTimeout(function(){
  setInterval(function(){
    console.lg("tock")
  }, 1000)
}, 500)
```

##### Results
```
tick
tock
tick
tock...
```

*12:12:48*

Event-loop architecture
run-loop architecture

*12:21:48*

#### Difference between Evented and Threaded architecture
- Evented architecture (e.g. Node.js)
    - one file clerk (never has to leave desk)
    - many messenger boys
- Threaded
    - multiple file clerks, no messengers
        - difficult to keep these in sync
    - can share across many CPUs

on the browser, the only approach is threaded. WIth command line apps you jsut need to do one thing and return it as quickly as possible


Now the tables have turned, now js looks much better than ruby

### Stream programming with Ruby

*12:27:01*

#### ```ruby-version.rb```
```ruby
begin
  loop do
    str = STDIN.readpartial(100)
    STDOUT.write str.upcase
    sleep 0.01 # see below for explanation
  end
rescue EOFError
  exit
end
```

##### Why we sleep above
```ruby
# This takes up an entire CPU (99%)
# It's hard for the kernel to get interupted and know other IO
# workers are going on
loop do
end
```

```
$ echo hello | ruby rubyer-version.rb
```



In this case, it's up to the programmer to decide the resolution (ie. sleeptime).

When programming on an event, this guess of a number is pushed out of your concern

*12:43:45*

### Node Version

#### ```node-version.js```
```js
// call this function every time some data appears on stdin
process.stdin.on('data', function(data){
  console.log("data received")
  process.stdout.write(data.toString('utf8')).toUpperCase()) // not console.log
})

// call this function when there is an error stdin
process.stdin.on('error', function(err){
  console.error() // logs to standard error
})

process.stdin.on('end', function(){
  consol.log('read stream ended')
})
```

```
$ ping devbootcamp.com | node node-version.js
```



##### Callback Pattern
```js
fs.readFile(filename, 'utf-8', function(err, fileContents) {
```


#### ```node-version.js```
```js
process.stdin.resume()

process.stdin.pip(process.stdout)

process.stdin.on('error', function(err){
  console.error() // logs to standard error
})

process.stdin.on('end', function(){
  consol.log('read stream ended')
})
```

**unsure of the accuracy of the above code**

streams come in two flavors, read & write. Not both.

#### etags
- fast, convenient way to not duplicate information over the wire

Getters and setters are a shady use of OO programming


log, or launch rockets are a good user

client-server
peer-peer

in node, you rarely see use of the ```new``` keyword


#### ```sams-example.js```
```js
var http = require('http');
var server = http.createServer();

server.on('request', function(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200);
  response.write("hello",
  response.end();
})

server.on('request', function(request, response) {
  console.log(requestt.url)
  console.log("new request coming in..")
})

server.listen(8080)
```


#### ```myles-version.js```
```js
var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(function(req, wstream) {
  console.log(req.url)
  wstream.write("hello)
  wstream.end()
})
.listen(8080,function() {
  console.log("listening on port", 8080) // you'll see this when we first start
})
```

## History

### [Tim Berners Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_berners_lee)
- World Wide Web
    - HTTP
    - HTML

[Mosaic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)) -> [Netscape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator) -> IE

### Internet
- Connects **every** computer to the **one** network
    - Not inevitable Tech, the idea that it's **one** network
- allows any two **programms** to talk to each other
- other things (like bittorrent)

[TCP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)
TCP/IP

> If you solve a problem so well, it just disappears
    - TCP/IP; the internet just works so well

### TCP/IP
- Should actually be called TCP/[UDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol)/IP
    - UDP was invented at the last minute by [David Reed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_P._Reed)
- Think of TCP stacked on top of IP
    - IP's goal: give every computer a unique address
        - lets every computer to address every other computer
            - lets one operating system to give a chunk of data to another to another operating system
            - get a chunck of bytes into a chunk, put them in an envelope, on yte outside of the envelope you putt the adress.
            operating styem gets the

> Everyone knows how to look at a design and add more shit to it. It's really hard to break pieces off of it.

which of these computers I'm connected to is closer? It's not the one where you came from

IP layer is unreliable, computer could pick it up, then just drop it

routing table

Need TCP sit on top of IP because IP is unreliable

IP is the layer with addresses

TCP is the layer with ports & streams

IP is like the address to the apartment building, TCP is like the number to the apartment.

conventions are the only things that make one port special over another

TCP Packets include
  port number
  sequence ID
  type (kind of packet being sent; different identifiers)

Pipe
  one directional; stout -> stdin

16:23:37

socket
  two directional;
    write stream
    read stream

DNS
  only job is to take a string and convert it into an IP address

Any TCP connection (only every between **two** programs)
  connector (e.g. chrome)
    knows the address of the listener
    chooses which port is connected on
  listener (e.g. rails. not always a server)
    doesn't know the address of the connector, until a connection is established

Once you have a TCP connection, you need to have a set of rules from there on out
  SMTP

Who talks first

http Packet
- content
    - Type of request (e.g. GET)
    - URL
    - Protocol version
    - line feed & carraige return
    - HTTP headers

16:34:11

HTTP Response
- content
    - HTTP 1.1
    - Status (e.g. 200)
    - optional: OK, or muffins...
    - headers (the only portion that looks similar)
    -

how does the browser know your response isn't just headers?


16:36:55

how do we open and listen to a socket

### [Netcat](http://netcat.sourceforge.net/)

```nc -l 4000```

establish a listener on 4000 in this case
a read stream

can also make a connection

```nc localhost 4000```

```echo hello | nc localhost 4000```

creates a socket, then sends it

```ping devbootcamp.com | nc localhost 4000```

if you don't stipulate stdin or stdout, it defaults to terminal

```
nc -l 4000
```

```
nc localhost 4000
```

you can now write in both terminals

visit ```http://localhost:4000/```

you'll see the dialogue

you can write back

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 6
```

\n

```
hello
```

then the browser sends another request

6 for 6 bytes

#### ```socket-listener.js```
```js

var net = require('net')

net.createServer(function(connection){
  connection.write("hello")
  connection.on("data", function() { })
}).listen(4000)
```

#### ```socket-listener.js```
```js

var net = require('net')

net.createServer(function(connection){

  console.log("new connection")

  connection.write("hello")
  connection.end()
}).listen(4000)
```

run ```socket-listener.js``` in the command line, then run ```nc localhost 4000```

#### ```socket-listener.js```
```js

var net = require('net')

net.createServer(function(connection){

  connection.write("HTTP/1.1 200 OK" + httpHeaderDelimiter)
  connection.write("X-Myles: awesome" + httpHeaderDelimiter)
  connection.write(httpHeaderDelimiter)
  var content = "hello browser"
  connection.write("Content-Length" + content.length + httpHeaderDelimiter)
  connection.write(httpHeaderDelimiter)
  connection.on("data", function(data) { console..og("data", data.toString())})
}).listen(4000)
```




#### ```socket-listener.js```
```js

var net = require('net')

var httpHeaderDelimiter = "\r\n"

net.createServer(function(connection){

  connection.on("data", function(data){
  var httpRequest = data.toString()
  var httpRequestLines = httpRequest.split(httpHeaderDelimiter)
  var firstLine = httpRrequestLines[0]
  var ulr = firstLine.split(' ')[1]

  connection.write("HTTP/1.1 200 OK" + httpHeaderDelimiter)
  connection.write("X-Myles: awesome" + httpHeaderDelimiter)
  connection.write(httpHeaderDelimiter) // end headers
  var content = "you asked for url: " + url
  connection.write(content)
  connection.end() // close connection

})

}).listen(4000)
```


#### ```socket-listener.js```
```js

var net = require('net')

var httpHeaderDelimiter = "\r\n"

net.createServer(function(connection){

  connection.on("data", function(data){
  var httpRequest = data.toString()


  connection.write("HTTP/1.1 200 OK" + httpHeaderDelimiter)
  connection.write("X-Myles: awesome" + httpHeaderDelimiter)
  connection.write(httpHeaderDelimiter) // end headers
  var content = "you asked for url: " + url
  connection.write(content)
  connection.end() // close connection

})

}).listen(4000)

function requestParser(str) {
  var httpRequestLines = httpRequest.split(httpHeaderDelimiter)
  var firstLine = httpRrequestLines[0]
  var ulr = firstLine.split(' ')[1]

  return {
  // method: method,
  url: url//,
  //headers: headers
}

function responseGenerator(res) {
  var str = ''
  str += "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" + httpHeaderDelimiter
  str += "X-Myles: awesome" + httpHeaderDelimiter
  str += httpHeaderDelimiter
  var content = "you asked for url: " + req.url
  return str
}


}
```

like writing a command line app. take some input make some output

if you can talk tcp/ip you can make a webserver
