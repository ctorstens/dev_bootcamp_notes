14:10:45 - 14:15:41: **Talk on CoffeeScript and it's meaning**

[Brendan Eich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich), the George Lucas of programming languages
  - > did one thing good once, and has spent the rest of his career fucking it up.

bundler problem

#### Global install (local install is default)
```
npm install -g coffee-script
```

```
$ coffee
```

14:28:53

### [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/)
- >Logic-less
    - put all the logic in the presenters, take it out of the templates

```
man man
```

brackets ```[xxx]``` typically mean optional

14:38:49: Why (1) & (5) [look at webpage]

```
man 1 troff
man 5
```

[ManPage Sections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page#Manual_sections)

Chris Wanstrath: founder of github, writer of mustache

14:43:00

#### [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
- tries to sell you a t-shirt, among other things
- has logic

#### [discourse](http://www.discourse.org/)

14:51:38

#### [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)
- unique designs
- **lots** of examples

#### [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)
- lots of hype, not many actual projects. give it scepticism

14:54:00

#### ```make```

```
foo: README.md
  echo $<
```

```
ui.html: ui-presenter.litcoffee ui.html.mustache user-data.coffee
  coffee $< > $@
```

same thing as

```
ui.html: ui-presenter.litcoffee ui.html.mustache user-data.coffee
  coffee ui-presenter.litcoffee > ui.html
```

$<


$@
  build product

>
  **redirects** standard out of the command

what's the difference between that and piping

|
  right hand side has to be a command

>
  right hand has to be a file

tee
  pipefitting command
  writes **and** displays

a pure templating language should only do substitution

```
src='{{ avatar_url }}'
```

notice it isn't ```@user.avatar_url```, which is entanglement

CooMPuTaH
- Controllers
    - Manage irreversible side-effects
- Models
    - Manages data, value, people
- Presenters
- Templates
    - logicless
- Helpers
    - most of your code (functional)

15:41:59

### Mustache has a concept of:
- substitutions
- blocks
- partials

#### Block
- user when you have an array you want to iterate over

```html
<div class="users">
  {{#users}}
    ...
  {{/users}}
</div>
```

```html
  {{#current_user}}
    Hello {{name}}
  {{/current_user}}
```

- we get block scope, if it doesn't find name, it goes up until it does

if the value is null, nothing gets written

any mustache template can be rendered from ```json``` or ```yaml```

15:47:10

```coffee
(function() { console.log("hello")}).call(this)
```

16:15:11

arrow to the right hand side of arguments

```coffee
(a, b) ->
```
```js
compiledTemplate = hogan.compile(templateSource("foo"));
```

same as

```coffee
compieledTEmplate = hogan.compile templateSource "foo"
```

```coffee
compieledTEmplate = hogan.compile templateSource, "foo"
```

same as

```js
compiledTemplate = hogan.compile(templateSource, "foo");
```

```ruby
foo = "bar"

def foo
  "baz"
end

puts foo
```

what about

```ruby
puts foo()
```

16:23:58

implicit return

How do I know when to take on a dependency?
answer at 16:40:00

#### [Wach](https://github.com/quackingduck/wach)

Myles made this

```
npm install -g wach
```

```
wach make
```

#### [RLD](https://github.com/quackingduck/rld)


```
wach -e ui.html, "make && rld chrome"
```

### [Github API](http://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/)

```
curl https://api.github.com/orgs/freaking-fiery-skippers
```

```
curl https://api.github.com/users/torsday
```

17:12:00

```
psql -h localhost -p 4000
```

connect to port 4000, lying to it saying there's a psql server there

##### impedence mismatch
- active record producing sql

```
curl -u "torsday" https://api.github.com/orgs/freaking-fiery-skippers/members
```

##### [Literate Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
- treating your program as if it were an essay, writing text and code together
- literally paragraphs to the user, then some source code
- concept invented by [Donald Knuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)

## MYLES TALK: **Donald Knuth** 17:28:27
- He wrote [TeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX), the precursor to [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), just so he could write [The Art of Computer Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming)
- Then he created [WEB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEB) for the same book

#### self-hosting
- you need to compile [TeX] first so that you can create it's own documentation


#### [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)
- [annotated source code](http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html)

*17:41:00*

#### [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/)

#### [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
- [coffeescript] is written in [coffeescript]
- everything that is indented is code, everything else is comments

#### [journo](https://github.com/jashkenas/journo)
- a blogging application

*17:55:11*

```
<filename>.litcoffee
```

coffeescript for loops are maps
