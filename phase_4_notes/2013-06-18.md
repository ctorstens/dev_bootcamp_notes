# Eric Raymond's principles of unix design



## Rule of Modularity

Developers shoudl build a program out of simple parts connected by well defined interfaces, so problems are local, and  parts of the program can be replaced in future versions to uspport new featurs this rull aims to save time on debugginc complex code that is complex long and unreadable


---

* Simple parts (one thing)
    * *uuid*
    * *ls* - just lists contents of current direcotry (or dir in argv)
    * *puts* - writes arg to stdout then writes newline
    * *p* - puts and also returns arg
    * *NokoGiri*
    * *URI*
    * *Faker*
    * *Secure Random* - just gives you a random number

* Complex parts (more than one thing)
    * ActiveRecord (OMG)
    * Browser
    * node
    * jQuery


* Well defined interfaces:
    * Good names

* Local
    * How much work is done with local info vs global info

# Rule of Clarity

Develeroprs should write programsas if the most important communnication is to the develoerps, includin him or herslef, hwom wil read rand maintiant eh program rather than the computer.  thes rule aims to make code radable coand comprehensible for whomever works on the code in future

---

* Clear:
    * Commentary around complex or confusing computations
    * Good naming, many comments can be made redundant ith good names
    * Whitespace to separate things
    * Formattig consistency
    * Well written readme files
    * Good documentation
    * Good results on google

* Unclear:
    * Crazy nesting levels - jagged left edge
    * Methods that do more than one things

**Keyword**: Communication - to who? The *developer*, not the computer

## Rule of Composition

# From here on out, look to what myles should have sent out.
