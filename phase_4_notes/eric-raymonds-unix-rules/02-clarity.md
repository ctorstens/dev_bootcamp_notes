# Rule of Clarity

Developers should write programs as if the most important communication is to the developers, including him- or herself, whom will read and maintain the program rather than the computer. This rule aims to make code readable and comprehensible for whomever works on the code in future.

---

Adds clarity:

* Commentary around complex or confusing computations
* Good naming, many comments can be made redundant with good names
* Whitespace to separate different concepts and ideas
* Consistent Formatting
* Well written readme files
* Good documentation
* Good googlejuice

Unclear:

* Crazy nesting levels - jagged left edge
* Methods that do more than one thing and have fuzzy names

Key word: communication - to who? The *developer*, not the computer
