# Rule of Simplicity

Developers should design for simplicity by looking for ways to break up program systems into small, straightforward cooperating pieces. This rule aims to discourage developers’ affection for writing “intricate and beautiful complexities” that are in reality bug prone programs.

Examples of breaking up into smaller programs:

* Obviously, unix commands
* Most of James Halliday's code: https://github.com/substack
* Refactored phase 4 "on duty" board
