# Rule of Transparency

Developers should design for visibility and discoverability by writing in a way that their thought process can lucidly be seen by future developers working on the project and using input and output formats that make it easy to identify valid input and correct output. This rule aims to reduce debugging time and extend the lifespan of programs.

Literate programming can increase transparency of your thought process when writing some code.

No comments and bad variable and function names obviously decreases it.
