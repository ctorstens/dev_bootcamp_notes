# Rule of Robustness

Developers should design robust programs by designing for transparency and discoverability, because code that is easy to understand is easier to stress test for unexpected conditions that may not be foreseeable in complex programs. This rule aims to help developers build robust, reliable products.

* Web browsers - you can feed them crazy shit, and they'll render something

* The more failures you can handle, the more robust you are

* If you can't handle any failure, you're fragile

Fragile -> Robust -> Antifragile

(See Nassim Nicolas Taleb's book: Antifragile)

Not robust:

* Pretty much everything you write when your still learning to program
